## ‚ö° OBINexus Unified Model ‚Äî *Tiered Integration Framework*

### **T1: Open Access ‚Äî Sensory Foundations (OpenSense)**

**Focus:** Open, neurodivergent-first access to the *phenomena* of signal coherence.
**Goal:** Democratize the study and design of ‚Äúreliable phenomena‚Äù through sensory computing.

| Dimension           | Description                                                          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Phenomena (PLP)** | Plasma ‚Üí Lightning ball ‚Üí Neural spark ‚Üí Communication signal        |
| **Technology**      | OpenSense Framework (7√ó7 sensory matrix)                             |
| **Use Case**        | Relay Therapy for non-verbal communication (as in the OBINexus case) |
| **Principle**       | Healing through feedback: system learns from human rhythm            |
| **Ethics**          | MIT + HACC License ‚Äî no ghosting, boundary sovereignty               |

üúÇ *Analogy:* Lightning‚Äôs uniform potential energy = brain‚Äôs pre-conscious coherence before thought.
**Both** become visible when polarized through interaction (plasma or puppet).

### **T2: Business Access ‚Äî Logical Infrastructure (OpenAxis)**

**Focus:** Build adaptive systems that translate sensory phenomena into *logic and structure*.
**Goal:** Commercialize stability ‚Äî bridge neurotypical workflows with neurodivergent insight.

| Dimension       | Description                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Logic (PLP)** | Uniform coherence models ‚Üí computational logic ‚Üí stable business process |
| **Technology**  | OpenAxis IaaS (X-Y-Z gating: workflow, validation, deployment)           |
| **Use Case**    | Real-time BCI interface translation (NeuroSpark / OBINexus systems)      |
| **Principle**   | Bridge from typical ‚Üí divergent systems (standard ‚Üí adaptive ‚Üí extended) |
| **Ethics**      | Constitutional compliance: sovereignty, explainability, accessibility    |

üúÉ *Analogy:* Lightning‚Äôs plasma sheath = OpenAxis bridge layer ‚Äî mediates chaotic energy into usable flow.

### **T3A / T3B: Knowledge Power ‚Äî Process and Governance**

**Focus:** Education, R&D, and large-scale therapeutic integration.
**Goal:** Establish the constitutional governance and certification layer for coherent human‚Äìmachine systems.

### üß≠ Interpretation

* **Phenomena column** = nature‚Äôs coherence
* **Logic column** = engineered understanding
* **Process column** = human-centered application

Together they form the **PLP Core** ‚Äî *Phenomenon ‚Üí Logic ‚Üí Process* ‚Äî mirrored across your tiered model:

* **T1**: Feel it
* **T2**: Structure it
* **T3**: Teach and protect it



**Process (PLP)**:
Reliable phenomena ‚Üí systemic coherence ‚Üí healing architecture ‚Üí constitutional governance.

üúÑ *Analogy:* Lightning resolving to ground = knowledge returning to society. Stability through discharge.
